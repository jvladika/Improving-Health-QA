[SEP] rationale: dietary patterns may alter immune responses and increase asthma risk or affect lung function.objectives: to examine whether a proinflammatory diet (assessed by the energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index [e-dii]) or high dietary quality (assessed by the alternative healthy eating index [ahei-2010]) are associated with current asthma, current asthma symptoms, and lung function in hispanic adults.methods: this was a cross-sectional study of 12,687 adults aged 18 to 76 years who participated in the hispanic community health study/study of latinos (hchs/sol).

Does diet cause bad breathe? [SEP] after controlling for confounders, processed meat consumption was negatively associated with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (fev1), forced vital capacity (fvc) and fev1/fvc ratio in males and females, while fruit and vegetable consumption and dietary tac were positively associated with fev1 and fvc, but not fev1/fvc ratio.

Does diet cause bad breathe? [SEP] among adults without asthma, a higher e-dii score was associated with lower forced expiratory volume in 1 second (fev1) and forced vital capacity (fvc), and a higher ahei-2010 score was associated with higher fev1 and fvc.conclusions: our findings suggest that a proinflammatory diet increases the risk of asthma and asthma symptoms in hispanic adults.
